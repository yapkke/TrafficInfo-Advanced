To build this project you need to copy over your local.properties from
any existing project.  The content of the file is something like the
following---stating where to find the Android related stuff in your
system:

  # location of the SDK. This is only used by Ant
  # For customization when using a Version Control System, please read the
  # header note.
  sdk.dir=/home/username/<some directory>/android
